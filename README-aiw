How to apply this patch:
========================

1. The patch is intended for 8-oct-2002 cvs snapshot, and
   would probably work for 1.9.4 release as well. 
   Make sure base snapshot compiles fine. If it doesn't,
   consult regular manuals and READMEs before patching.

2. Copy aiw.patch to mp1e source topmost directory.

3. patch -p0 <aiw.patch

4. recompile

5. look into examples.sh for usage examples.
